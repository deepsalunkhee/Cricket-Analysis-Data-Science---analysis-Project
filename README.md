# Cricket-Analysis-Data-Science---analysis-Project

Hello, connections 👋,

I recently started my journey to explore the exciting realm of data science😁. After going through various articles, blogs, and videos, I realized just how vast and overwhelming this domain can be🤯. However, rather than getting bogged down by the sheer amount of information, I decided to dive in and get my hands dirty and try to gain some practical understanding.

To achieve this, I first brushed up on my #python programming👨‍💻 skills and brushed up on my #math for #datascience. I then decided to start with #datavisualization, which is a crucial aspect of data science. By recreating some available projects, I was able to
understand the flow and process required for #datavisualization.:
->Define the problem statement
->Scope the requirements
->Collect the data
->Process the data
->Transform the data
->Model the data

In this project, I have tried to create a dashboard that uses data from the T20 world cup to give the best players according to the filter we have applied

I utilized #powerbi as my visualization tool, and the entire process was a fantastic learning experience. Moving forward, I'm eager to take on more data visualization projects and explore further steps in data science, such as #machinelearning and #deeplearning . If you have any resources or recommendations that can guide me in this exciting field, please pls let me know.
